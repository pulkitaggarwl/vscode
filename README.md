# Deploy to Azure from VS Code

[Get it on the VS Code Marketplace!]()

This VS Code extension helps you set up continuous build and deployment for Azure WebApps without leaving VS Code.

![Configure Pipeline Demo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/microsoft/azure-pipelines-vscode/master/resources/configure-pipeline.gif)

To set up a pipeline, choose *Deploy to Azure: Configure CI/CD Pipeline* from the command palette (Ctrl/Cmd + Shift + P) or right-click in the file explorer. The guided workflow will generate a starter YAML file defining the build and deploy process.

For code having GitHub as its git remote, you can customize the pipeline using all the features offered by [GitHub Actions,](https://github.com/features/actions) else you can customize the pipeline using all the features offered by [Azure Pipelines.](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/devops/pipelines/) 

Once the setup is completed, an automatic CI/CD trigger will fire for every code push. 

## Telemetry

## Troubleshooting failures

- **Selected workspace is not a Git repository**: You can configure a pipeline for a Git repository backed by GitHub or Azure Repos. Initialize your workspace as a Git repo, commit your files, and add a remote to GitHub or Azure Repos. Run the following commands to configure git repository:

    `git init`

    `git add *`

    `git commit -m <commit-message>`

    `git remote add <remote-name> <remote-url>`

- **The current branch doesn't have a tracking branch, and the selected repository has no remotes**: You can configure a pipeline for a Git repository backed by GitHub or Azure Repos. To add a new remote Git repository, run `git remote add <remote-name> <remote-url>`

- **Failed to determine Azure Repo details from remote url**: If you're configuring a pipeline for a Git repository backed by Azure Repos, ensure that it has a remote pointing to a valid Azure Repos Git repo URL.
